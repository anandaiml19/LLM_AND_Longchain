      "Title: What is Artificial General Intelligence? Definition from TechTarget\n",
      "Text: What is artificial general intelligence (AGI)? Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the representation of generalized human cognitive abilities in software so that, faced with an unfamiliar task, the AGI system could find a solution. The intention of an AGI system is to perform any task that a human being is capable of. Definitions of AGI vary because experts from different fields define human intelligence from different perspectives. Computer scientists often define human intelligence in terms of being able to achieve goals. Psychologists, on the other hand, often define general intelligence in terms of adaptability or survival. AGI is considered to be strong artificial intelligence (AI). Strong AI contrasts with weak or narrow AI, which is the application of artificial intelligence to specific tasks or problems. IBM's Watson supercomputer, expert systems and self-driving cars are examples of narrow AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "AGI vs. AI: What's the difference? Existing artificial intelligence capabilities are referred to as narrow AI when compared with artificial general intelligence. AGI is theoretical, whereas narrow AI is in practical use today. AGI should theoretically be able to perform any task that a human can and exhibit a range of intelligence in different areas without human intervention. Its performance should be as good as or better than humans at solving problems in most areas. In contrast, weak AI excels at completing specific tasks or types of problems. Many existing AI systems use a combination of machine learning (ML), deep learning (a subset of machine learning), reinforcement learning and natural language processing (NLP) for self-improving and to solve specific types of problems. However, these technologies do not approach the cumulative ability of the human brain. Examples of AI in use today include the following: Customer service chatbots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voice assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation engines such as those Google, Netflix and Spotify use to promote content to users.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI-powered business analytics and business intelligence (BI) tools that conduct data analysis, gauge customer sentiment and present data visualizations for end users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image and facial recognition applications as well as the deep learning models they use. Existing artificial intelligence capabilities are referred to as narrow AI when compared with artificial general intelligence. AGI is theoretical, whereas narrow AI is in practical use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of artificial general intelligence True AGI systems are not on the market yet. However, examples exist of narrow artificial intelligence systems that approximate or even exceed human abilities in certain areas. Artificial intelligence research is focused on these systems and what might be possible with AGI in the future. Here are some examples of those systems: IBM's Watson. Watson and other supercomputers are capable of calculations that the average computer can't handle. They combine their immense computing power with AI to carry out previously impossible science and engineering tasks, such as modeling the Big Bang theory of the birth of the universe or the human brain.\n",

Expert systems. These AI-based systems mimic human judgement. They can recommend medicine based on patient data and predict molecular structure, for example.\n",

ROSS is a legal expert system that is also called the AI attorney .

This is another example of narrow intelligence that excels at a specific type of problem solving. AlphaGo is a computer program that can play the board game Go. Go is a complex game that is difficult for humans to master. In 2016, AlphaGo beat the world champion Lee Sedol in a five-game match.\n",

GPT-3 and GPT-4 are release versions of a program from OpenAI that can automatically generate human language. The technology is consistently able to emulate general human intelligence. In some cases, the text is indistinguishable from human output; however, the AI output is often flawed.\n",

Dadabots is an AI algorithm that, given a body of existing music, can generate a stream of its own approximation of that music. If AGI were applied to some of the preceding examples, it could improve their functionality. For example, self-driving cars require a human to be present to handle decision-making in ambiguous situations. The same is true for music-making algorithms, language models and legal systems. These areas include tasks that AI can automate but also ones that require a higher level of abstraction and human intelligence.\n"
